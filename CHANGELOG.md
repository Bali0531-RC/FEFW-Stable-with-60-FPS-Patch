# Changelog

## v1.2.1

- **All settings are now global** (*Emulation → Configure*) instead of in a Fortune's Weave per-game profile, including the 12 GB memory layout. A per-game profile only applies when the game's ID matches exactly, so some dumps (for example a `.nup` packed with a different ID) or an old `user` folder copied over could fall back to the defaults, including 4 GB, which hangs on loading. The global settings now match what the profile had: GPU accuracy Fast, asynchronous shaders on, vsync off, 16x anisotropic filtering, reactive flushing off, VRAM Conservative, FSR at 50% sharpness, anti-aliasing off. The emulator itself is unchanged from v1.2.

**Updating from v1.2:** no need to re-download if your game loads. Otherwise set *Emulation → Configure → System → Memory Layout* to **12 GB**, or extract v1.2.1 and copy your `user\nand` folder into it.

## v1.2

> **The 60 FPS patch is now OFF by default.** Its frame pacing is poor and can feel choppy, while 30 FPS runs flawlessly. It's still included: to try it, right-click the game → *Properties → Add-Ons* and tick **60fps**.

> **Saves are stored next to `eden.exe`** (in `user\nand`), **not** in `%APPDATA%\eden`. See [Saves](README.md#saves).

- **60 FPS patch off by default** (unticked under *Add-Ons*; the files are still included).
- **AMD graphics fix:** shader registers read before being written are now zero, as on NVIDIA, instead of leftover garbage that can show as stray coloured patches on AMD GPUs. Ported from [Djihads80's Eglantine](https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine) (by arisqz). No change on NVIDIA.
- **Preset graphics:** AMD FSR window adapting filter at 50% sharpness, anti-aliasing off (was FXAA).
- **Building from source fixed:** `cmake-options.txt` is now in the repo, and the README lists exactly what to put together.
- `source.zip` updated with the AMD fix.

**Updating from v1.1:** extract v1.2 to a new folder and copy your old `user\nand` folder into it to keep your saves. If you copy the whole old `user` folder instead, your old graphics and 60 FPS settings come with it.

## v1.1

> **The 60 FPS patch has poor frame pacing: it can feel choppy and uneven. At the game's normal 30 FPS this build runs flawlessly.**
> The patch is on by default. For the smoothest experience, turn it off. If it still feels choppy **delete** the folder `user\load\04007EF01F8AE000\60fps` (next to `eden.exe`). Unticking it under *Add-Ons* isn't always enough.

> **Saves are stored next to `eden.exe`** (in `user\nand`), **not** in `%APPDATA%\eden`. Copy your `nand` folder in to keep existing saves. See [Saves](README.md#saves).

- **`.nup` support.** Fortune's Weave can now be played from a single `.nup` package as well as from loose files. Add the folder that holds it to the game list, or open it with *File → Load File*. The NUP loader is ported from [Djihads80's Eglantine](https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine) (GPL-3.0-or-later). Only playing is supported: packing, unpacking and editing NUPs aren't included, and add-on content inside a `.nup` isn't loaded.
- **VRAM Usage Mode is now Conservative** in the Fortune's Weave profile (it was Aggressive). On Aggressive the texture cache can grow to almost the whole graphics card during a long session and spill into system RAM, causing repeated one-second freezes of picture and sound after about half an hour. Conservative caps it at about 6 GB plus 1 GB per resolution-scale step.
- The download zip now uses standard forward-slash paths, so it extracts correctly with 7-Zip and other tools as well as Windows.
- `source.zip` is updated with the NUP code.
- **Switching from loose files to `.nup`?** The two save to different folders (`0000000000000000` vs `04007EF01F8AE000` inside your profile folder). Copy the first to the second to carry your progress over. See [Saves](README.md#saves).

**Updating from v1.0:** extract v1.1 to a new folder, then copy your old `user\nand` folder into it to keep your saves (or copy the whole old `user` folder to keep your settings and shader cache too). If you copy the whole `user` folder, set VRAM Usage Mode to Conservative yourself: right-click the game → *Properties → Graphics → Advanced*.

## v1.0

- First release: portable build of xDarkWindx's eden-fefw 1.12 (on Duck912's Fortune's Weave fork) with a start-up crash fix, settings tuned for Fortune's Weave, the 60 FPS patch and the Microsoft C++ runtime included.
